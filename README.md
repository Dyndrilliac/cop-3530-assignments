This code makes use of my [Custom Java API](https://github.com/Dyndrilliac/java-custom-api). In order to build this source, you should clone the repository for the API using your Git client, then import the project into your IDE of choice (I prefer Eclipse), and finally modify the build path to include the API project. For more detailed instructions, see the README for the API project.

This repository contains all of the code that was written for the programming projects assigned in COP 3530. Project 2 and Project 7 were written using C and the rest were all completed using Java. All of the solutions have the source code and the original instructions. All of the solutions earned the maximum number of points. Dr. Martin required all of the Java code for the original assignments to be in one source file, and so each Java assignment once contained a separate primitive version of my Custom Java API. They have since been updated to each utilize my current unified code base of support packages where appropriate.
